    "## Weighted Independent Sets in Path Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** Path graph $G = (V, E)$ with nonnegative weights.  \n",
    "**Output:** Subset of nonadjacent vertices (independent set IS) of maximum weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 4\n",
    "max-weight IS: [4, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S \\subseteq V$ be a max-weight independent set IS.  \n",
    "Let $v_n$ be the last vertex of the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 1:** $v_n \\notin S$\n",
    "* Let $G' = G - \\{v_n\\}$\n",
    "* $S$ is also max-weight IS in $G'$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2** $v_n \\in S$:\n",
    "* $v_{n-1} \\notin S$ (by definition of IS)\n",
    "* Let $G'' = G - \\{v_{n-1}, v_n\\}$\n",
    "* $S - \\{v_n\\}$ is max-weight IS of $G''$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upshot:** A max-weight IS must be either\n",
    "1. a max-weight IS of $G'$ or\n",
    "2. $v_n$ + a max-weight IS of $G''$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corollary:** If we knew weather or not $v_n$ was in the max-weight IS, recursively compute max-weight IS of $G'$ or $G''$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Try both possibilities and return the better solution.  \n",
    "**Problem:** Takes exponential time because it has a branching factor of 2.  \n",
    "**However:** We only have $O(1)$ distinct subproblems.\n",
    "**Solution:** Cache solutions for subproblems for a later $O(1)$ lookup (memoization). Reformulate algorithm as bottom-up iterative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $G_i$ be the 1st $i$ vertices of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plan:** Populate array $A$ keft to right with $A[i]$ = value of max-weight IS of $G_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Init $A[0] = 0, A[1] = w_1$\n",
    "2. For $i = 2, ..., n$: $A[i] = max(A[i - 1], A[i - 2] + w_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Runs in $O(n)$ time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reconstructing the Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm returns max weight of max-weight IS. To get the path of the max-weight IS, we can trace back through the filled out array and reconstruct the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:** $v_i$ belongs to max-weight IS of $G_i$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ $w_i$ + max-weight IS of $G_{i-2}$ $\\leq$ max-weight IS of $G_{i-1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let $A$ be the filled in array, init empty list $S$\n",
    "2. While $i \\geq 1$ (scan right to left):\n",
    "    * if $A[i-1] \\geq A[i-2] + w_i$:\n",
    "        * $i = i - 1$\n",
    "    * else:\n",
    "        * Add $v_i$ to $S$; $i = i - 2$\n",
    "3. Return $S$."
